1. Why did you choose the tools, libraries, and language you used for the coding exercise?

I chose to use java as my coding language for this assignment because it is the language I am most comfortable working with.
I have many years of experience coding in java under my belt so I naturally turned to it here. I used many of the specific 
libraries in response to the prompt and assignment given at hand. There were many steps to the program that involved importing 
essential packes such as I/O, and time packages.


2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of your solution?

Some advantages of my solutions include that it is quite efficient and simple/short. It tackles the problem presented accurately
and spends points based on the rules that were given. Additionally, it checks for correct argument inputs, and checks for IO
Exceptions. A disadvantage of the solution is that it is one dimensional in the sense that it needs a specific number of 
arguments passed in an in a specific order. 


3. What has been a favorite school/personal project thus far? What about it that challenged you?

One of my favorite projects that I have worked on was a project on creating and replicating red black trees. At first, this was
a challenge to me because it was so different from other search trees that I was used to working with. However, that is also 
what made it especially interesting to me. There were many more complex operations and steps to consider compared to other search
trees. While this was a new task at first, it felt great to figure out and see a working model after really understanding how red
black trees worked in the end.
